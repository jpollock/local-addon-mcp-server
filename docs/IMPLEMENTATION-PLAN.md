**Goal:** Cloud backup management (requires `localBackups` feature flag)
**Design Document:** [PHASE-10-BACKUPS.md](./PHASE-10-BACKUPS.md)
**Branch:** `feature/phase-10-backups`

### Phase 10a: Status & Discovery ✅

| Task | Tool | Priority | Status |

**Design Decisions:**
- Dropbox + Google Drive only (Local's supported providers)

- `restore_backup` requires `confirm=true`
- `delete_backup` requires `confirm=true`
- Uses BackupService with Restic + Rclone architecture

---

## Phase 11: WP Engine Connect/Sync ✅ Complete

**Goal:** WP Engine hosting integration with Magic Sync support
**Design Document:** [PHASE-11-WPE-CONNECT.md](./PHASE-11-WPE-CONNECT.md)

| 11a.3 | `wpe_logout` | High | ✅ |
| 11a.4 | `list_wpe_sites` | High | ✅ |

### Phase 11b: Site Linking (Simplified) ✅

**Note:** Simplified to expose existing connection data. Link/unlink tools removed (connections created via Pull in Local UI).

| Task | Tool | Priority | Status |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| 11b.1 | Enhance `list_sites` with wpeConnection | High | ✅ |
| 11b.2 | `get_wpe_link` | High | ✅ |

| 11c.3 | `get_sync_history` | Medium | ✅ |
| 11c.4 | `get_site_changes` | High | ✅ |
| ~~11c.5~~ | ~~`get_sync_progress`~~ | ~~Medium~~ | ⏭️ Skipped (progress in Local UI) |

**Design Decisions:**
- WP Engine only (Flywheel deferred)
- `includeSql` defaults to `false` (safer)
- `push_to_wpe` requires `confirm=true`
- OAuth tokens stored in system keychain
- Sync operations start async, progress shown in Local UI

---

## Not Recommended for MCP

The following features are explicitly excluded:
- **Account management** - Security (OAuth tokens, credentials)
- **Cloud storage auth** - Security (Dropbox/GDrive OAuth)
- **Feature flag changes** - Admin-level, could break app
- **Addon management** - Complex lifecycle, user control preferred
- **Settings changes** - Global app settings, user preference
- **Hosts file edits** - Security risk
- **Router daemon control** - System-level, dangerous

---

## Next Steps (Recommended Priority)

### Immediate
1. **v0.0.1 Released** - ✅ Complete
2. **Test on Windows and Linux** - Verify cross-platform compatibility (Phase 7.1)
3. **End-to-end test all 14 tools** - Verify each tool works correctly

### Short-term (Phase 8 Quick Wins)
4. **Add `export_database`** - Use WP-CLI `db export` (no GraphQL changes)
5. **Add `import_database`** - Use WP-CLI `db import` (no GraphQL changes)
6. **Add `open_adminer`** - Browser URL open (no GraphQL changes)
7. **Add `open_in_editor`** - Shell command (no GraphQL changes)

### Medium-term
8. **Add `import_site`** - Import from zip (requires GraphQL work)
9. **Add `trust_ssl`** - Service exists (minimal work)
10. **Add `toggle_xdebug`** - Service exists (minimal work)

### Long-term
11. **Phase 10: Backup tools** - If feature flag enabled
12. **Phase 11: Connect tools** - If user demand exists
13. **Local Addon Marketplace** - Official distribution

| Cross-platform issues | Test on all platforms | ⏳ Pending |
| GraphQL addSite incomplete | Added custom createSite mutation | ✅ Resolved |
